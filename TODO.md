## üîß Development Notes

### PocketFlow Best Practices (From Production Experience)
- ‚úÖ No try/except in node execution - use framework error handling
- ‚úÖ No arbitrary text cropping - utilize full LLM context windows  
- ‚úÖ Proper shared store access: prep() ‚Üí exec() ‚Üí post()
- ‚úÖ Use Batch Nodes for "for each X" operations
- ‚úÖ Keep utility functions focused on external APIs/complex logic
- ‚úÖ Make design concrete and specific, avoid hand-wavy descriptions

### Implementation Priority
1. ‚úÖ **Core Flow** - Get basic offer comparison working end-to-end
2. ‚úÖ **Market Intelligence** - Add real-time data and AI research
3. ‚úÖ **Personalization** - Implement weighted scoring and preferences  
4. ‚úÖ **Visualization** - Create interactive charts and comparisons
5. ‚úÖ **Polish** - Professional reports, optimization, testing

## üöß Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [x] **Gemini API Integration** - Add Google Gemini support for users without OpenAI
- [x] **Environment Configuration** - .env file for API keys
- [x] **Conda Environment** - environment.yml for easy setup
- [x] **Unit Testing** - Test coverage for all components
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Caching and async improvements

### Medium Priority
